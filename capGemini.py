"""
We are building a program to manage a gym's membership. The gym has multiple members, each with a unique ID, name, and membership status. The program allows gym staff to add new members, update members status, and get membership statistics.

Definitions:
* A "member" is an object that represents a gym member. It has properties for the ID, name, and membership status.
* A "membership" is a class which is used for managing members in the gym.

We are currently updating our system to include information about workouts for our members. As part of this update, we have introduced the Workout class, which represents a single workout session for a member. Each object of the Workout class has a unique ID, as well as a start time and end time that are represented in the number of minutes spent from the start of the day. You can assume that all the Workouts are from the same day.

To implement these changes, we need to add two functions to the Membership class:

2.1) The `add_workout` function should be used to add a workout session for a member. If the given member does not exist while calling this function, the workout can be ignored.

2.2) The `get_average_workout_durations` function should calculate the average duration of workouts for each member in minutes and return the results as a map.

To assist you in testing these new functions, we have provided the test_get_average_workout_durations function.
